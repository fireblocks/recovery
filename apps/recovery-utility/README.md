## üìö User Guide

1. Set up a dedicated offline recovery machine. It must be:
   - Offline and air-gapped
   - Accessible only by necessary, authorized personnel
   - Protected with a very strong password
   - Encrypted on all partitions
   - Stored in a safe box when not in use
2. [Install the latest release of Recovery Utility](https://github.com/fireblocks/recovery/releases) on the offline recovery machine.
3. **(Optional)** [Install the latest release of Recovery Relay](https://github.com/fireblocks/recovery/releases) on a web server. [Recovery Relay](../recovery-relay/) is a companion web app that gets wallet balances and sends transactions without revealing your private keys.
4. Open Recovery Utility to use one of the following tools...

### üß∞ Tools

#### üÜï Set Up Recovery Kit

Generate an RSA keypair and checksum for a new Recovery Kit. If you already have your backup .zip, RSA keypair with passphrase, and owner's mobile app passphrase, then you can skip this and proceed to Verify Recovery Kit.

</p>

#### ‚úÖ Verify Recovery Kit

With your Recovery Kit .zip, RSA private key with passphrase, and owner's mobile app passphrase, you can verify your ability to perform a hard key recovery. Recovery Utility uses these materials to generate your workspace's `xpub` and `fpub` extended public keys. Check that the these extended public keys match the keys in your Fireblocks Console Settings.

</p>

#### üîë Recover Private Keys

With your Recovery Kit .zip, RSA private key with passphrase, and owner's mobile app passphrase, you can recover the extended private keys (`xprv` and `fprv`) of your Fireblocks workspace, derive wallets to recover your assets' private keys, and create transactions by scanning a QR code to the Recovery Relay web app.

##### üö® WARNING

Using private key recovery exposes your private keys to the host machine. Only do this in a disaster recovery scenario, and then move your assets to other secure wallets. Use the Fireblocks Console, APIs, and SDKs for standard operations.

## üî® Development

Recovery Utility is a cross-platform [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The window UI is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, using [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) components.

[Recovery Utility](../recovery-utility/) includes the compiled [@fireblocks/extended-key-recovery](../../packages/extended-key-recovery/) module in its [contents](https://www.electron.build/configuration/contents.html#extrafiles) and spawns it as a child process to restore a workspace's extended private/public keys. It uses [@fireblocks/wallet-derivation](../../packages/wallet-derivation/) to derive wallet keys and addresses.

### Scripts

#### Develop

```sh
yarn dev
```

#### Build

```sh
yarn build
```

### Build Process

Using Turborepo the [@fireblocks/extended-key-recovery](../../packages/extended-key-recovery/) module is first compiled to an executable for the development machine's architecture. Then Recovery Utility's renderer process (the Next.js frontend) is transpiled to static HTML/JS/CSS. Finally, the renderer and module are bundled with the Electron main process into an application bundle for the development machine's architecture.

Cross-compilation is not supported. We use GitHub Actions with a matrix job to compile Recovery Utility for each supported architecture (masOS, Windows, and Linux).

### Security

The Electron main process disallows opening or redirecting to external URLs and disables Chrome permission requests (e.g. webcam access, clipboard reading). No external content is loaded.
